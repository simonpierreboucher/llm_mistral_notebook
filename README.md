### Notebooks Overview

1. **MISTRAL-CHATBOT.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook likely demonstrates how to use the Mistral model as a chatbot, focusing on dialogue management and response generation.
   - **Contents**: It may contain steps to initialize the model, preprocess input text, and set up a loop or function for generating responses based on user prompts.
   - **Usage**: Suitable for developers looking to implement a chatbot application powered by the Mistral model, allowing for interactive Q&A or conversational AI.

2. **MISTRAL-RAG.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook likely focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a method where the model retrieves relevant information from a source (like a document or dataset) before generating responses.
   - **Contents**: The notebook may include code for integrating a retrieval component, using similarity search (likely with embeddings), and combining retrieved data with generative responses.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for applications that require precise, contextually relevant answers, such as customer support or FAQ systems, where the model responds based on specific information sources.

3. **MISTRAL-TEXTGEN.ipynb**
   - **Purpose**: This notebook likely provides an interface for experimenting with text generation capabilities, focusing on creative or informational text outputs.
   - **Contents**: Steps for setting up prompts, adjusting generation parameters (like temperature or max length), and generating text based on user inputs are expected here.
   - **Usage**: Useful for tasks such as content creation, summarization, or any project needing high-quality, generative text outputs.

Each notebook provides a different approach to leveraging Mistral LLMs, making this repository versatile for various LLM-driven applications.

### Navigation and Usage

To use these notebooks:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter by navigating to its location and running `jupyter notebook`.
2. Follow the instructions and code cells within each notebook to set up and interact with the model in the respective use case (Chatbot, RAG, or Text Generation).
